This was created with CubeMX, as a "board project" for the STM32H747 Disco board, then the TouchGFX add-on was installed and configured.

Then the code was exported from CubeMX as an STM32CubeIDE project. 
This generated a touchgfx.part file in CM7/TouchGFX. I opened this in TouchGFX Designer 4.17 on windows. Then I added a text object "SomeText" and clicked "Generate code"
This created some files that the IDE needed to build the project.
IDE was opened and the project was compiled (had to also add the path to the lbtouchgfx.a library for the linker).
Then I created compile_commands.json using compiledb -v < /Users/design/4ms/stm32/eclipse/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.cdt.ui/touchgfx-h747_CM7.build.log
